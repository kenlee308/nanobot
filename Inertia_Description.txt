# Inertia-Nanobot
**Type:** Python / Batch Automation Tool
**Description:**
Inertia-Nanobot is a lightweight, local AI agent system designed to work with Ollama. It features a "switch connectivity" system allowing it to toggle between different local models (like GPT-OSS, Gemma 3) with specific configurations for context length and tool availability. It includes a "Nanobot" chat interface and RAG capabilities.

**Key Features:**
- **Model Switching:** Easily switch between models with optimized presets (e.g., 20b models with 4k context, 4b models with 8k context).
- **RAG Support:** "Retrieval-Augmented Generation" allows the bot to read files from a workspace directory.
- **Tool Use:** Supports native tool calling or text-only modes depending on the model's capabilities.
- **Safety**: Includes "Hide JSON Mode" to prevent raw tool calls from leaking into the chat.

**How to Use:**
1.  **Start Server:** Run `Run_nanobot.bat`.
2.  **Chat:** Run `nanobot_chat.bat` to open the chat interface.
3.  **Switch Models:** Use `switch_model.bat` to select a different AI model and configuration.
4.  **Help:** Run `nanobot_help.bat` to see available modes and options.
5.  **RAG:** Place text files in your workspace folder to make them searchable by the agent.
